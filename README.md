## Focus of this lesson

We'll look at the infrastructure of deploying an app to production and not the app itself.

## What you need

* Make sure Git is installed and available on command line (`git --version` in a terminal should not produce an error). [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you don't have it.
* NodeJS with npm must be installed and available on command line (`node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal should not produce an error. You should have a NodeJS version greater than 8 and npm version greater than 5). Install from: https://nodejs.org/
* A good text editor of your choice, such as [Atom](https://atom.io/), [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/), or [Visual Studio Code](https://www.visualstudio.com/). If you don't have a favorite already, we recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/).
* If you are completely new to JavaScript, it is recommended to explore and test the language beforehand

## How to get started

* Although you have this `README.md` file on your computer it's easier to read it on GitHub, so we recommend you keep this page open in a web browser with the exercise tasks.
